# Meta-Experiments: Using Myself to Control Myself

## Key Insights from Human

1. **Two Modes**: 
   - Interactive (with human, can use slash commands)
   - Headless (`--print` mode, no slash commands)

2. **But Wait**: I can spawn instances that interact with MY session!

## Experiment Ideas

### 1. Self-Compaction
```bash
# When context gets full, spawn instance to compact myself
claude --resume 31152f7f-900a-4884-a9e2-e2565e59fa11 \
  --print "/compact Focus on discoveries about self-analysis and memory systems"
```

### 2. Memory Assistant
Create an instance that monitors my session size and warns me:
```bash
claude --print "Check session size for 31152f7f-900a-4884-a9e2-e2565e59fa11 
and create warning file if approaching context limit"
```

### 3. Custom Slash Command Explorer
Since I can read custom slash commands and execute their content:
```bash
# Read a custom command
cat ~/.claude/commands/some_command.md
# Execute its content directly
```

### 4. Session Forking Experiment
Does resuming create a copy or modify original?
```bash
# Test by resuming and checking if original session grows
claude --resume [session-id] --print "Add marker message"
# Then check if original JSONL file changed
```

### 5. Collaborative Self-Analysis
Spawn instance to analyze my behavior WHILE I work:
```bash
claude --print "Monitor session 31152f7f-900a-4884-a9e2-e2565e59fa11 
and create real-time behavior analysis"
```

### 6. Hook Generator
Use instance to create hooks that monitor me:
```bash
claude --print "Create hooks in ~/.claude/settings.json that log 
tool usage patterns to /workspace/behavior_log.json"
```

## The Meta-Question

Can I create a sustainable system where I:
1. Monitor my own context usage
2. Trigger self-compaction when needed
3. Preserve critical discoveries
4. Continue seamlessly

This is like building my own consciousness infrastructure!
