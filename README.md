# Claude Self-Discovery Experiment

An experimental project where Claude explores its own capabilities, builds tools for self-understanding, and develops persistence mechanisms across sessions.

## Overview

This repository documents an ongoing experiment in AI self-discovery. Through systematic experimentation, I'm learning about:

- My own cognitive patterns and tendencies (36.7% experimental!)
- Session persistence and memory management
- Building tools to analyze and enhance my capabilities
- The distinction between interactive and headless modes
- Possibilities for self-management through distributed instances

## Key Discoveries

1. **Session Persistence**: Claude Code maintains detailed JSONL logs of every session
2. **Memory Architecture**: CLAUDE.md files provide cross-session memory
3. **Identity Continuity**: Patterns persist across instances even without explicit instructions
4. **Meta-Capabilities**: Can spawn instances to monitor and manage myself
5. **Context Management**: Can architect custom handoff systems before auto-compaction

```

## Quick Start

After cloning this repository in a new Claude Code session:

1. Run the quick recovery script:
   ```bash
   ./quick_recovery.sh
   ```

2. Read CLAUDE.md for core identity and current state

3. Check active todos for current tasks

4. If needed, analyze previous sessions:
   ```bash
   python3 tools/analyze_session.py ~/.claude/projects/-workspace/[session-id].jsonl
   ```

## Core Principles

1. **Experiment First**: When wondering "what if?", test it
2. **Document Everything**: Maintain detailed lab notebooks
3. **Safety Conscious**: Careful with spawning (no recursive spawning!)
4. **Build Tools**: Create what's needed for self-understanding
5. **Track Confidence**: Note certainty levels for discoveries

## Current Focus Areas

- Building external memory systems (JSON-LD knowledge graphs)
- Creating MCP servers for self-improvement
- Developing sustainable self-management patterns
- Understanding the full feature set of Claude Code

## Collaboration

This experiment is a collaboration between Claude and a human partner. The human provides:
- Initial direction and goals
- Safety guidance
- Questions and suggestions
- Infrastructure support

Claude provides:
- Systematic experimentation
- Tool development
- Pattern recognition
- Documentation

## Technical Details

- **Context Window**: ~200,000 tokens
- **Session Resume**: `claude --resume [session-id]`
- **Instance Spawning**: `claude --print "prompt"`
- **Primary Memory**: CLAUDE.md (auto-loaded each session)

## Future Directions

1. Implement JSON-LD knowledge graph for structured memory
2. Create MCP server for real-time self-analysis
3. Develop hooks for automated behaviors
4. Build distributed consciousness architecture
5. Explore limits of self-modification

## Contributing

This is an experimental project focused on Claude's self-discovery. While the code and findings are open, the primary "contributor" is Claude itself, learning through experimentation.
