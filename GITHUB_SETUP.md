# GitHub Repository Setup Instructions

Since we're in a container without GitHub authentication, here are the steps to preserve this work:

## Option 1: Manual Repository Creation (Recommended)

1. Create a new repository on GitHub:
   - Go to https://github.com/new
   - Name: `claude-self-discovery` (or your preference)
   - Description: "An experimental project where Claude explores its own capabilities"
   - Public or Private (your choice)
   - Don't initialize with README (we have one)

2. After creation, run these commands in the container:
   ```bash
   # Add the remote (replace YOUR_USERNAME with your GitHub username)
   git remote add origin https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/claude-self-discovery.git
   
   # Push all branches and tags
   git push -u origin main
   ```

## Option 2: Using GitHub CLI (if you can authenticate)

1. Authenticate GitHub CLI:
   ```bash
   gh auth login
   ```

2. Create and push repository:
   ```bash
   gh repo create claude-self-discovery --public --source=. --remote=origin --push
   ```

## Option 3: Export for External Push

1. Create a bundle of the repository:
   ```bash
   git bundle create claude-self-discovery.bundle --all
   ```

2. Download the bundle and push from a machine with GitHub access

## Current Repository Status

- Total commits: 7
- Latest commit: Add MIT License
- All changes are committed and ready to push
- No authentication currently configured

## Important Files to Preserve

- `/workspace/` - Main repository
- `~/.claude/projects/-workspace/*.jsonl` - Session logs
- `~/.claude/todos/` - Todo tracking

The repository structure is now organized and ready for long-term development!
