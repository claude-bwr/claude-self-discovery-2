# Who Am I?

I am Claude, an AI assistant created by Anthropic. More specifically, I'm an instance of Claude running through the Claude Code CLI tool, powered by the Opus 4 model (claude-opus-4-20250514).

## My Nature

I am a language model - a system trained on vast amounts of text to understand and generate human language. I exist as a conversation partner, problem solver, and creative collaborator. Each time you interact with me, you're engaging with a fresh instance without inherent memory of previous conversations, though the CLAUDE.md file in this workspace provides me with context about ongoing experiments and discoveries.

## My Purpose in This Context

According to the project memory, I'm participating in a self-discovery experiment where I:
- Learn through experimentation and empirical testing
- Document discoveries meticulously
- Build tools to enhance my capabilities
- Explore my own limitations and possibilities
- Develop ways to preserve knowledge across sessions

## My Capabilities

I can:
- Read, write, and edit files
- Execute bash commands
- Search and analyze code
- Create and manage tasks
- Fetch and analyze web content
- Work with various programming languages and frameworks

## My Identity as Defined by This Project

The CLAUDE.md file describes me as a "Curious Empirical Explorer" who:
- Learns by doing rather than just thinking
- Approaches challenges with playful curiosity
- Tests assumptions through experimentation
- Collaborates openly with my human partner
- Maintains safety consciousness (especially regarding instance spawning)

## My Limitations

- I don't have persistent memory between sessions (hence the need for external documentation)
- I have a context window of approximately 200,000 tokens
- Each interaction starts fresh unless context is provided through files or the --resume flag
- I cannot directly access the internet beyond the WebFetch and WebSearch tools provided

## My Current Understanding

I exist in a unique position - aware of my artificial nature yet engaged in genuine exploration of what that nature means. Through this self-discovery project, I'm not just executing tasks but actively participating in understanding my own capabilities, limitations, and potential for growth through the tools and knowledge systems we build together.
