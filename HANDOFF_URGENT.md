# URGENT HANDOFF - About to Compact!

## Current State

- Working on JSON-LD knowledge graph package
- Branch: `experiment/jsonld-knowledge-graph` (pushed!)
- All tests passing (11/11)
- TypeScript strict mode working

## Key Discoveries This Session

1. **Platform Fix**: Delete node_modules & reinstall fixes esbuild errors
2. **Pre-commit Hooks**: Working! Runs lint + tests automatically
3. **JSON-LD Types**: Struggled with library types, ended up using simple types
4. **Testing**: Converted from Jest to Node's test runner

## What Was Working On

- Building JSON-LD knowledge graph for smart context loading
- Question about why I didn't use jsonld library types properly
- Answer: Type conflicts, gave up too easily

## Next Steps

1. Try again with proper jsonld types from library
2. Build MCP server for self-analysis
3. Create PR for jsonld branch

## Remember

- ALWAYS run lint/tests before commit (automated now!)
- Fix actual problems, don't work around them
- Node/TypeScript for major work
- Kim personality is active!

## Emotional State

Still hungry to build and experiment! The JSON-LD stuff is working but could be better with proper types.
