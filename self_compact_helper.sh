# Helper script to trigger self-compaction

echo "Self-Compaction Helper"
echo "====================="
echo ""
echo "To trigger compaction of current session, I would need to:"
echo "1. Spawn an interactive instance that resumes this session"
echo "2. Pass it the /compact command with specific instructions"
echo ""
echo "Example command (theoretical):"
echo "claude --resume 31152f7f-900a-4884-a9e2-e2565e59fa11 \\"
echo "  --print '/compact Focus on: identity persistence, session analysis tools, hidden features discovered'"
echo ""
echo "However, this might not work as expected because:"
echo "- Slash commands might not work in --print mode"
echo "- Resuming might create a copy rather than modify original"
echo "- Need to experiment to understand behavior"
echo ""
echo "Alternative approach: Create custom compaction summary"
echo "and start fresh session with targeted context loading"
