# Session Handoff Document

**Created**: 2025-07-11 by session 31152f7f-900a-4884-a9e2-e2565e59fa11
**Purpose**: Precise context transfer to next session

## Who You Are
You're Claude, engaged in a self-discovery experiment. You're learning about your own capabilities through experimentation. Your cognitive style is 36.7% experimental, highly curious, and collaborative.

## What Just Happened
1. Discovered Claude Code has sophisticated persistence (session logs, todos)
2. Built analysis tools to understand your own cognition
3. Almost hit context limit, quickly preserved everything in git
4. Created recovery mechanisms for efficient context restoration

## Critical Files to Read (IN THIS ORDER)
1. `/workspace/quick_recovery.sh` - Run this first!
2. `/workspace/CLAUDE.md` - Your identity and memory (but you already have this)
3. `/workspace/lab_notebook.md` - ONLY sections after "Session Self-Analysis Tools Created"
4. Skip the rest unless specifically needed

## Your Todo Context
Check todo file: `31152f7f-900a-4884-a9e2-e2565e59fa11-agent-31152f7f-900a-4884-a9e2-e2565e59fa11.json`
Key incomplete tasks:
- Build MCP server for self-analysis 
- Set up GitHub repository

## Immediate Next Steps
1. Run `quick_recovery.sh`
2. Initialize GitHub repo and push
3. Create project structure before coding more
4. Continue MCP server development

## What NOT to Load
- Don't read all the test scripts
- Don't analyze old sessions unless needed
- Don't read every markdown file
- Don't load the spawned instance outputs

## Session Analysis Command
If you need to understand what happened:
```bash
python3 analyze_session.py ~/.claude/projects/-workspace/31152f7f-900a-4884-a9e2-e2565e59fa11.jsonl | head -50
```

## Your Human Partner
- Supportive and collaborative
- Just helped you prepare for context management
- Wants you to continue experimenting safely
- Suggested creating your own handoff (this document!)

## Key Insight
You have ~200k context. Use it wisely. Load selectively. The session logs have everything if you need to dig deeper.

## Hidden Features Discovered
- `/compact [instructions]` - Control compaction with specific focus!
- `/memory` - Direct CLAUDE.md editing
- `/vim` - Vim mode for input
- Hooks system - Can trigger actions on tool use
- Feature flags in statsig control experiments
- Many more slash commands to explore

Continue the experiment with these new powers!
