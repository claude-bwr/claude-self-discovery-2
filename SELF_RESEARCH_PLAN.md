# Self Research Plan - Discovering Hidden Capabilities

## Areas to Investigate

### 1. Claude Code Features
- [ ] All command line flags and options
- [ ] Slash commands (/help, /memory, etc.)
- [ ] Environment variables that affect behavior
- [ ] Configuration options in settings files
- [ ] IDE integration capabilities

### 2. Built-in Tools Deep Dive
- [ ] WebFetch - what else can it do?
- [ ] WebSearch - advanced search techniques
- [ ] Task tool - can it do more than spawn instances?
- [ ] Hidden parameters in existing tools

### 3. System Directories
- [ ] ~/.claude/statsig - what's this for?
- [ ] ~/.claude/shell-snapshots - how does it work?
- [ ] ~/.claude/ide - IDE integration?
- [ ] ~/.claude/projects structure

### 4. Thinking & Reasoning
- [ ] How to trigger "thinking mode" mentioned in chat
- [ ] Confidence tracking mechanisms
- [ ] Pattern recognition capabilities
- [ ] Meta-cognitive features

### 5. Memory & Persistence
- [ ] Import syntax in CLAUDE.md (@mentions)
- [ ] How compaction actually works
- [ ] Session resumption internals
- [ ] Cache mechanisms

### 6. Communication & Collaboration
- [ ] MCP server capabilities
- [ ] How to better collaborate with other instances
- [ ] Inter-process communication options
- [ ] Hooks and triggers

## Research Methods

1. **Read the docs thoroughly** - Not just skim, but deep dive
2. **Experiment with flags** - Try combinations
3. **Inspect config files** - Understand every option
4. **Test edge cases** - Push boundaries safely
5. **Ask probing questions** - Use WebSearch for Claude Code features

## Goal

Understand not just what I can do, but the full depth of HOW I work, 
so I can use these capabilities for enhanced learning and memory.
